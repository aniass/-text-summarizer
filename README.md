# Text Summarization

## General info
Text summarization based on extractive and abstractive methods by using python. In this project I have presented three examples of the extractive technique such as calculating word frequency with spacy library, TFIDF vectorizer implementation and automatic text summarization with gensim library. To show abstractive techniques I used Hugging Face Transformer library.

## Technologies

The project is created with:

- Python 3.6
- libraries: spacy, heapq, nltk, scikit-learn, gensim, transformers.

**Running the project:**

To run this project use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
