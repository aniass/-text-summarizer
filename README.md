# Text Summarization

## General info
Text summarization based on extractive and abstractive methods by using python. In this project I have presented three examples of the extractive technique such as calculating word frequency with spacy library, TFIDF vectorizer implementation and automatic text summarization with gensim library. To show abstractive techniques I used Hugging Face Transformer library.

### Dataset
In our analysis we used data come from [BBC news](https://www.bbc.com/news).
