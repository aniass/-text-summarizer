# Text Summarization

## General info
Text summarization based on extractive and abstractive methods by using python. In this project I have presented three examples of the extractive technique such as calculating word frequency with spacy library, TFIDF vectorizer implementation and automatic text summarization with gensim library. To show abstractive techniques I used Hugging Face Transformer library.

### Dataset
In this project I have used an article coming from [BBC news](https://www.bbc.com/news).

## Project contains:
- text summarization by using several methods - **Text_summary.ipynb**
- text summary by word frequency model with spacy - **spacy_summary.py**
- text summary by TF-IDF model and gensim library - **tfidf_gensim_summary.py**
- text summary by Bart model and transformers - **bart_summary.py**
- data - data used in the project.

## Technologies

**The project is created with:**

- Python  3.6/3.8
- libraries: spacy, heapq, nltk, scikit-learn, gensim, transformers.

**Running the project:**

To run this project use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
